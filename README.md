"Hey, why are there no files here for me to copy?" Is what I'm guessing you're thinking. Well, Cloud9 has decided to just NOT recognize my SSH key and not let me push to main. Typical piece of shit technology right? Best part is, I'm already having an awful day. I genuinely want to shoot myself. Not even kidding. This mental anguish I feel every goddamn day because of this mindfucking school system has brought me to my lowest point ever.
